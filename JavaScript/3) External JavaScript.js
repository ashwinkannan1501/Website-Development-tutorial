/*
External JavaScript File :-
-----------------------------
    We can create the external JavaScript file and embed it in many HTML pages.
    It provides "code reusability" because a single JS file can be used in several HTML pages.
    An external JS file must be saved by ".js" extension.
    It is recommended to embed all JavaScript file into a single file. It increases the speed of the web page.
    If it is a few lines of code, then better to implement the internal JavaScript code.
